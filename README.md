# MBot Scratch GUI
The MBot Scratch GUI is a fork of the [Scratch Foundation GUI](https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-gui/), which is a set of React components that comprise the interface for creating and running Scratch 3.0 projects. This fork contains a custom extension that enables Scratch blocks for controlling the University of Michigan MBot.

## Installation
To install the MBot Scratch GUI, you must first install the [MBot Scratch Virtual Machine](https://github.com/broderio/mbot_scratch_vm). The VM contains the implementation of the MBot Extension Blocks.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/broderio/mbot_scratch_vm
cd mbot_scratch_vm
./install_scripts/install.sh
```

Now, we can install the GUI.
```bash
npm install
npm link scratch-vm
```
To enable the service that will host the MBot Scratch application on boot, run the following commands.
```bash
cd services
./install_services.sh
```

## Start the Application
To start the MBot Scratch GUI, run the following command. If you have enabled the service, then there is no need to start the application manually.
```bash
npm start
```

## Development Notes
The original Scratch GUI and Scratch VM repositories receive about 100 commits per week because of dependency bot updates. This leads to Scratch creating several new releases of the VM and GUI *every week*. Every once in a while, we should sync our forks with the original repositories. To do this, use the following commands.

### GUI
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-gui.git
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/develop
```
At this point, there will likely be merge conflicts. They should only be in [`package-lock.json`](https://github.com/broderio/mbot_scratch_gui/blob/develop/package-lock.json). Resolve these conflicts before continuing. Once the merge conflicts are resolved, finish the rebase.
```bash
git rebase --continue
git config pull.rebase false
git pull
git push
```

### VM
Follow the above instructions, but replace the link for the Scratch GUI with the link to the Scratch VM.
